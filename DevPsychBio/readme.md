# readme

In this repository, you can find all the files associated with the manuscript under review by Morales et al. in Developmental Psychobiology. 

The manuscript was also posted as a preprint here: https://psyarxiv.com/ag9s7/

The scripts are not perfectly integrated, but they are commented to allow you to see what was done for the paper. 

We are currently working on a paper about time frequency analyses that is done in a tutorial-style that will be much easier to follow. 
We will update some of that work in this repository. 

If you have any questions or comments about this scripts, please contact Santiago Morales (moraless@umd.edu).
