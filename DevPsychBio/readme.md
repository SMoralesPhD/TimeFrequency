# readme

In this repository, you can find all the files associated with the manuscript under review by Morales et al. in Developmental Psychobiology. 

The manuscript was also posted as a preprint here: https://psyarxiv.com/ag9s7/

The scripts are not perfectly integrated, but they are commented to allow you to see what was done for the paper. 

We currently have a paper under review on time frequency analyses that is done in a tutorial-style that will be much easier to follow. 
You can find that paper here: https://psyarxiv.com/dcek3/
We will update some of that work in this repository. 

If you have any questions or comments about this scripts, please contact Santiago Morales (Santiago.Morales@usc.edu).
